    <!----------- INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE ------------->

        <h3 class="criticalTitle">Critical Reflection</h3>
        <p class="criticalText criticalText-1">
          In July 2023 I began an industry placement at a software company, in
          which I joined the development team as a Software Engineer. In this
          role I was tasked with developing an API and authentication workflow
          to integrate with company products. During this placement, I
          encountered a series of experiences and challenges that prompted me to
          critically examine my actions and their impact on the project.
          Ultimately this helped foster a sense of self-awareness and a
          commitment to continuous improvement.
          <br /><br />There are two key experiences from this placement that
          challenged my traditional values and project decision making: API
          design/development changes and assisting a different team on their
          project.
        </p>
        <img class="expImg apiImg" src="../img/api.jpg" />
        <p class="criticalText criticalText-3">
          Developing the project was largely an independent role, in which I
          applied problem solving skills to navigate knowledge gaps in
          programming languages. I drew on learning experiences from previous
          assessments and employed systematic code review as a research method
          to enhance my understanding of the project codebase. The project
          structure was based on a previously developed schema, which slightly
          differed from a similar company product. <br><br>The existing product had more
          features which would have made my project more challenging for the
          client to navigate, but would be beneficial for the industry partner
          to implement for future growth. I evaluated the advantages and
          drawbacks of incorporating this design and opted to include these
          additional modules in the codebase, while keeping them optional and
          hidden from the client's perspective. This approach preserved the
          logic for future use but ensured a simple and efficient user
          experience for the client as previously designed.
        </p>
        <img class="expImg apiImg" src="../img/repo1.jpg" />
        <p class="criticalText criticalText-4">
          Throughout the placement, various members of the development team were
          tasked with different projects. One project was undergoing a major
          milestone that required further assistance with quality assurance. I
          was asked to help with this task and had the opportunity to utilise
          testing skills I had acquired throughout my Computer Science degree.
          This task was a challenge in terms of ensuring my primary project did
          not fall behind its time schedule. It meant that I had to adapt
          original plans to incorporate new tasks. It did however introduce me
          to a different side of the software development life cycle.
        </p>
        <img class="apiImg sdlc" src="../img/sdlc.jpg" />
        <p class="criticalText criticalText-5">
          My actions to update the project schema were influenced by both
          personal characteristics and environmental learning. My traditional
          approach to thinking tends to be structured and methodical, often
          involving extensive planning to ensure project adherence. In the
          placement environment where real clients are involved however, this
          mindset is not always realistic. It is significantly different to a
          university project environment where the client is purely theoretical.
        </p>
        <p class="criticalText criticalText-6">
          My thoughts and actions when assisting on a different project were
          also shaped by personal traits. Traditionally I’m more familiar with
          working either independently or as part of a group on a set project,
          rather than transitioning between multiple deliverables. My limited
          experience with this type of dynamic working environment coupled with
          my structured thinking approach, presented challenges as I navigated
          completely different projects within the same working day. I likely
          experienced this pressure because I hadn't adequately prepared for
          unforeseen interruptions. This could have included setting scheduled
          time at the end of each week for additional/unrelated project
          assistance. This experience has deepened my understanding of the
          importance of strong planning and adaptability in achieving the
          company's overarching goals. It has become evident that certain
          projects may demand immediate attention to ensure client satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p class="criticalText criticalText-7">
          I highly value these experiences and their effect on my placement and
          course learning outcomes. I have come to appreciate the balance
          between structured thinking and adaptability, and upholding
          professionalism to ensure client satisfaction. While my inclination
          towards methodical planning has its benefits in more structured
          university work, I now recognise the importance of flexibility in
          real-world software development, especially when dealing with diverse
          projects and unexpected interruptions. While this adaptability may add
          personal pressure, I value the need to remain receptive to unforeseen
          events that can occur within a project. This newfound understanding
          has deepened my appreciation for considering the long-term
          implications of design decisions, striking a balance between immediate
          client satisfaction and future growth of a product.
        </p>
        <p class="criticalText criticalText-8">
          My new understanding of product design tactics and pre-planning will
          be important for me in my future career as a Software Engineer and in
          general life. Practising code review to better understand similar
          products, and furthermore catering for future development will better
          equip myself for meeting client requirements and improving business
          growth. This is likely applicable to all software projects that I will
          undertake in the future, and I must continue to hone these skills to
          achieve the most out of my projects whilst maintaining ethical
          conduct. Life in general is unpredictable, and these experiences will
          encourage me to practice pre-planning for unexpected events. I can
          achieve this by brainstorming potential scenarios and contingency
          plans, whilst embracing a flexible approach to challenges, such as
          large financial and career decisions.

        <div class="ethicsGrid">
          <p class="grid3 ethics-1">
            Throughout my ICT industry placement, I encountered several
            experiences that prompted critical reflection on the importance of
            professional accountability and ethical conduct in the industry. One
            instance revolves around responsible data handling. In this
            scenario, I was involved in creating, and managing access to, client
            and industry partner account information. This data was used in an
            authentication workflow to secure a RESTful API with Azure’s Active
            Directory. <br /><br />Poor data handling in this scenario could
            have resulted in unauthorised access to the API endpoints,
            potentially allowing external users to capture data and impersonate
            clients, posing significant security and privacy risks. To mitigate
            this risk, I ensured all client-identifiable data was not recorded
            in any API documentation, and data masking was used for all
            sensitive data entries.<br /><br />
            I created training and awareness documentation for the respective
            clients outlining how to handle their credentials to access the API.
            This included information on Microsoft recommended libraries for
            authentication workflows, to discourage direct HTTP request
            implementation.
          </p>
          <img class="grid2 expImg authImg" src="../img/auth.jpg" />
          <img class="grid5 expImg meetingImg" src="../img/meeting.jpg" />
          <p class="grid4 ethics-2">
            A second instance of ethical awareness in my industry placement
            revolves around upholding professionalism. Throughout the placement
            I participated in daily standup meetings, where I communicated my
            work plans and progress with the project team. Furthermore, I was
            required to create and deliver API workflow diagrams to the project
            team for communications with the client.<br /><br />
            To uphold professional conduct in these situations, I prioritised
            respectful and inclusive communication strategies. This included
            active listening and being open to team member feedback on my work.
            For documentation, I ensured it followed the company formatting
            policy to maintain consistency and professionalism. These strategies
            worked well, as they helped create a transparent and efficient
            working environment. Team members felt heard and respected because
            of positive communication strategies, and work was delivered to the
            expected standard.<br /><br />
            One aspect that I could have improved upon was seeking feedback
            earlier in the development process, for better time management. The
            daily standup meetings are a great opportunity to clarify work,
            however I appreciate that further discussions may be necessary. It
            is important to identify when further help is required to maintain
            project time scheduling.
