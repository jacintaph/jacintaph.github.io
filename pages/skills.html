        <p class="skillsText skillsText-1">
          Reflecting on my industry placement experience, I had the opportunity
          to develop and apply several technical skills and knowledge areas that
          contributed to my growth as a Software Engineer. These skills not only
          enhanced my capability but also aligned with my chosen major and
          career aspirations in the field of software development. These areas
          include Identity and Access Management (IAM), software development,
          and software testing.

        <p class="skillsText skillsText-2">
          The main placement project involved developing an API secured with
          Azure‚Äôs Active Directory (AD) for authentication. This task required
          knowledge of the Azure platform and its authentication workflow that
          uses client credential information and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to grant
          access to a Web API.
        </p>
        <p class="skillsText skillsText-3">
          Implementing this layer of security was completely new to me, and thus
          extensive research was required to understand the concept. Both
          industry partner led tutorials and independent research was completed
          to learn about sending and receiving client credentials, decoding
          secure JWT‚Äôs to verify access, and applying this access to all API
          endpoints. This included research on Role Based Access Control (RBAC),
          where the API owner can assign ‚Äúroles‚Äù to clients depending on their
          level of access. This role is then used to verify the client identity
          when accessing the API and allowing or disallowing certain
          functionalities. I utilised Azure‚Äôs documentation websites for this
          work, along with cross-platform documentation for JWT decoding.
        </p>
        <img class="jwtImg testImg" src="../img/jwt2.jpg" />
        <p class="skillsText skillsText-4">
          Following this research, I successfully implemented a secure
          authentication workflow for the project API. I was able to create a
          client in Azure‚Äôs AD portal and assign/modify roles for API access.
          The API successfully allowed and prohibited access when expected. I
          now feel very confident to apply my knowledge of Identity and Access
          Management practices, including JWT decoding, Azure AD authentication,
          and RBAC implementation.
        </p>
        <p class="skillsText skillsText-5">
          These skills and authentication knowledge are highly relevant to my
          degree and software development major. Security is critical for public
          applications, and confidence implementing a secure authentication
          method can be applied to all future Azure applications I work on if
          required. As a Full Stack developer, who may work on a variety of
          different platforms, my new knowledge of RBAC and JWT decoding is also
          easily transferrable, and I am confident now to modify implementation
          for various platforms.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Software Development and Quality Assurance</h3>
        <p class="skillsText skillsText-6">
          Creating the API deliverable involved a high amount of code
          development and testing. Specifically, an individual endpoint was
          coded to fulfil each unique functionality e.g., creating, updating,
          and viewing a record. I created an automated unit test per endpoint to
          confirm it achieved what was expected. These unit tests were coded
          using the TestBox framework, which provides a clean syntax for
          conveying what each endpoint should exactly do.
        </p>

        <p class="skillsText criticalText-7">
          I had a beginner-intermediate level of prior knowledge and skill in
          these areas, obtained through previous work experience as a Software
          Engineer Intern, and via my software development major. Through my
          major courses I had intermediate experience working with POSTMAN - an
          API testing program, and had previously developed a small number of
          API endpoints using the industry partner's preferred coding language.
          Experience using POSTMAN was extremely helpful for testing endpoints
          that required external data to be passed to the API. It helped me
          confirm the correct formatting and naming conventions for data to send
          to the API to create/update resources.
        </p>
        <img class="testImg" src="../img/pman.jpg" />
        <p class="skillsText criticalText-8">
          My previous knowledge helped initiate the project, however I found
          that code review was necessary to fully understand the scope of the
          API endpoints. Further API documentation research was also required to
          ensure my work met the National API guidelines. This research was
          concerned with ensuring the API was version controlled and used
          appropriate requests (create/update/view).
        </p>
        <p class="skillsText criticalText-9">
          Following my research and development I successfully implemented all
          required API endpoints with a 100% testing pass rate. This meant that
          each endpoint achieved its expected results. The API endpoints
          effectively retrieved, stored, and updated information in the database
          for further use. The mock image below shows the testing framework used.
        </p>
        <img class="testImg" src="../img/testbox4.webp" />
        <p class="skillsText criticalText-10">
          The extended skills and knowledge I gained working on my industry
          partner's code base to develop the API was a fantastic way to work
          towards my career aspirations. It helped me appreciate a more
          commercial side of software development, and the requirements for
          meeting National Guidelines for software. These are key skills of
          back-end development and a crucial aspect of Full Stack work. I now
          have a greater understanding of the inner methods and protocols of
          another software application, which I can successfully apply to future
          projects.
